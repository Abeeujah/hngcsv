The File System to be Operated on is read into the program using Node's inbuilt File System and Path Module
File System Creates A read Stream, splitting data into chunks
The chunks are piped to the csv-parse module
The parsed csv data is converted to JSON by the Jsonize function
In the Jsonize, the JSON file for each nft is built using the CHIP-0007 format
The hash of the JSON file is generated using sha256 standard
The generated hash is appended to the CSV File loaded
Input npm run start in terminal to see the script in demo

Basic Flow is:
Read CSV from Local Directory
JSON File Is Generated per NFT entry in the CSV
Each JSON File is Hashed using sha256 standard
The sha256 hash is appended to the csv file.

modules used include
File System - To read and write from file, Create JSON File too.
Path - to provide absolute file path
Crypto - to get the file hash
CSV-Parse - to parse csv files into javascript objects
